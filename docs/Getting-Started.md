# Getting Started

## Usage

> **Important**: Read over the [Feathers documentation](http://feathersjs.com/#documentation), specifically the section on [Services](http://feathersjs.com/#toc12). All of the Feathers REST and Socket API requests are supported.

### Run example:

Run the following:

```
node example/index.js
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/todo](http://localhost:8080/todo). 
There will likely be an empty array in response. This is because you have no `Todo`s, yet.

I recommend the [Postman extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm) if you would like an easy to use REST Client.
